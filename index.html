		<b><p><center>HEY FOLKS, IT'S TIME TO LAND UH?<br /><br /></center>
		
		Are you tired of all this expensive NFTs? YEAH, so do i, that's why we set an affordable price for our collection! Only 0.005 ETH, no gas fees (polygon blockchain)<br /><br />
		The Baby Alien Dinasty collection includes 3333 BAD. Have you ever seen a baby alien...? NO? Same for me, but these ones are INSANE, check the collection on OPENSEA, IF YOU DON'T TRUST ME!
		<br />
		<br /><br /><h1><b><center>MAIN CHARATERISTICS</center></h1></b><br />
		-> Like the original CryptoPunks, the BADs were created in 24x24 Pixel :)<br /><br />
		-> They cost only 0.005 ETH for the moment, but price will increase soon! :)<br /><br />
		-> Ours is a long-term collection, which, when something related to space (like Elon Mask lands on Mars LOL) or aliens happens, will explode and take us TO THE MOOON<br /><br />
		-> We do weekly giveaway on our discord server for holders of BAD<br /><br />
		-> Some of the are so rare that can be considered a tresure!<br /><br />
		-> They are all different from each other, and their phisical charateristics can be read on their page!We vhave used over 100 traits to create our BADs<br /><br />
		-> We didn't copy any other collection, we only took inspiration from a few collections, but we definitely differentiated ourselves in everything!<br /><br />
		-> Who don't like babies and Aliens??<br />
		<br /><br />
		<h1><b><center>HOW TO MINT THEM</center></b></h1><br />
		Each BAD can be minted directly on OPENSEA by clicking the button on top of this website, that redirect you to our collection, where you can chose your favorite one, and buy your favourite BAD at the listed price (in WETH so no gas fees are needed).<br /><br />
